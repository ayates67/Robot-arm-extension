## Milestone 1

As of right now, we have finished the arm attachment and the phone holder. Next we need to find a code, and wire up servos to make the phone rotate back and forth. We have achieved our first milestone because we built the 2 parts we said we would. These a pictures of our finished parts in cad. The first is the phone holder, the second is the axle that the servos will use to turn, the third is the arm attachment.

## Milestone 1

As of right now, we have finished the arm attachment and the phone holder. Next we need to find a code, and wire up servos to make the phone rotate back and forth. We have achieved our first milestone because we built the 2 parts we said we would. These a pictures of our finished parts in cad. The first is the phone holder, the second is the axle that the servos will use to turn, the third is the arm attachment.

## Finish assembly

Today I finished all of the part and assembly. This picture shows a phone holder attached to an axel and 2 servos. The servos will rotate forward and backward to the person's liking. The objective of the project is to make a arm attachment that will hold a phone while giving you the freedom to move both hands. This project will allow you to eat, watch the news, and use the other hand for fidgiting, playing cards, or just resting.
